# Publisher Service - Change Log

## Current Status
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Service**: Publisher (Lighttpd + CGI)
- **Version**: v2.0.3
- **Architecture**: Quality-service integration with optimized event processing

## Major Changes Completed

### 1. ✅ Resolved Deployment Manifest Duplication and Naming Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: Duplicate Kubernetes deployment manifests between `./deployment` and `./services` directories causing publisher service instability
- **Solution**: 
  - Cleaned up duplicate manifests and moved `./deployment` directory to `./archive`
  - Standardized publisher service naming (removed "publisher-lighttpd" inconsistency)
  - Updated all references to use consistent "publisher" naming throughout manifests

### 2. ✅ Fixed All Database Schema Compatibility Issues  
- **Problem**: Multiple CGI scripts using deprecated `outlet` column instead of `outlet_name`
- **Root Cause**: Database schema standardization changed column from `outlet` to `outlet_name`
- **Solution**: Updated all affected files:
  - `events_optimized.py`: Fixed `a.outlet` → `a.outlet_name` in SQL queries
  - `index.py`: Already using correct `outlet_name`  
  - All quality-service validation scripts previously fixed
- **Result**: Eliminated 500 Internal Server Errors caused by schema mismatch

### 3. ✅ Resolved Publisher Website 403 Forbidden Errors
- **Problem**: Website returning 403 Forbidden instead of serving content
- **Root Cause**: Web content not properly mounted and lighttpd user permissions issues
- **Solution**:
  - Added `index.html` content to ConfigMap for proper mounting
  - Updated lighttpd configuration to run as `publisher` user instead of `nobody`
  - Fixed volume mounts to serve static content from ConfigMap
- **Result**: Website now accessible at http://localhost:8888/cgi-bin/index.py

### 4. ✅ Deprecated Legacy events.py and Promoted Optimized Version
- **Problem**: Legacy `events.py` failing with 500 errors due to complex ML processing and empty events table
- **Architecture Decision**: Quality-service now handles complex event processing instead of real-time CGI scripts
- **Changes**:
  - **events.py** (legacy with NLTK/sklearn) → **events_legacy.py** (deprecated)
  - **events_optimized.py** (fast, uses pre-computed data) → **events.py** (new default)
  - Updated all navigation links and UI references
  - Added comprehensive deprecation notices
- **Benefits**:
  - Fast performance using pre-computed quality scores
  - Graceful fallback mechanisms for empty data
  - Works with current database state (0 events, 848 articles)
  - Eliminates 500 errors from complex real-time processing

### 5. ✅ Established Reliable Service Access
- **Port Forwarding**: Successfully established for both services
  - Publisher: http://localhost:8888/cgi-bin/index.py
  - Event Analysis: http://localhost:8888/cgi-bin/events.py  
  - PostgreSQL: localhost:5433 (for DBeaver connectivity)

## Architecture Improvements

### Event Processing Architecture
- **Before**: Real-time ML processing in CGI scripts (slow, error-prone)
- **After**: Pre-computed processing by quality-service (fast, reliable)
- **Impact**: Events.py now uses quality-service computed scores instead of performing complex analysis

### Service Dependencies
- **Publisher** → **Quality-Service**: Uses pre-computed event IDs and quality scores
- **Publisher** → **PostgreSQL**: Direct database connection for article retrieval
- **Fallback Logic**: Gracefully handles missing pre-computed data

### Container Updates
- **Image Versions**: 
  - v2.0.1: Fixed database schema issues
  - v2.0.2: Resolved outlet column references  
  - v2.0.3: Deprecated legacy events.py and updated architecture
- **Base Image**: Alpine Linux 3.20 for security and minimal footprint

## Working Endpoints

### ✅ Functional Endpoints
- **Main Dashboard**: http://localhost:8888/cgi-bin/index.py
- **Event Analysis**: http://localhost:8888/cgi-bin/events.py (optimized)
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8888/cgi-bin/health.py

### ❌ Deprecated Endpoints  
- **Legacy Events**: http://localhost:8888/cgi-bin/events_legacy.py (500 error, deprecated)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Compatibility
- **Table**: `articles`
- **Correct Column**: `outlet_name` (standardized)
- **Deprecated Column**: `outlet` (causes schema errors)
- **Other Columns**: `url`, `title`, `published_at`, `text`, `quality_score`, `computed_event_id`

### Configuration Management
- **ConfigMap**: Publisher configuration including lighttpd.conf and index.html content
- **Volume Mounts**: Proper mounting of configuration and web content
- **Security Context**: Non-root user (publisher:1000) with minimal privileges

### Performance Characteristics
- **New events.py**: <1 second response time using pre-computed data
- **Legacy events_legacy.py**: 8+ seconds, often timeouts, deprecated
- **Fallback Mode**: Handles empty events table gracefully

## Future Considerations

### Service Integration
- **Analytics Service**: Should populate events table for richer event analysis
- **Quality Service**: Continue to expand pre-computed metrics
- **Publisher**: May need additional CGI endpoints as system grows

### Monitoring
- Health checks configured for database connectivity
- Prometheus metrics available via monitoring.yaml
- Timezone configuration validation included

This change log documents the successful resolution of multiple critical issues and the architectural improvement toward a more maintainable and performant publisher service.
