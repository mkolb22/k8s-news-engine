## Testing & Validation

### Automation Rule Testing Checklist

#### Rule 1: Build Failure Detection
- [ ] Trigger test build failure in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Verify bug issue is created automatically  
- [ ] Confirm notification sent to correct recipients
- [ ] Check issue contains accurate failure details

#### Rule 2: PR Integration
- [ ] Create PR with K8SNE issue key in title
- [ ] Verify issue transitions to "Code Review"
- [ ] Merge PR and confirm transition to "Testing"  
- [ ] Check PR number is populated in custom field

#### Rule 3: Deployment Tracking
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Verify issue updates with deployment info
- [ ] Deploy to production and confirm issue resolution
- [ ] Test deployment failure scenario

#### Rule 4: SLA Monitoring
- [ ] Create critical issue and wait 4+ hours
- [ ] Confirm escalation triggers automatically
- [ ] Verify stakeholder notifications sent
- [ ] Check SLA labels applied correctly

### Performance Considerations

#### Rule Optimization Guidelines
- Limit JQL queries to specific time ranges where possible
- Use smart values efficiently to reduce API calls
- Implement conditions to prevent unnecessary rule executions
- Monitor rule execution frequency and performance

#### Monitoring Rule Performance
```jql
# Query to monitor automation rule execution
project = K8SNE AND labels in (automated, build-failure, deployment-failure) 
AND created >= -7d ORDER BY created DESC
```

## Maintenance & Updates

### Monthly Rule Review Tasks
1. **Analyze rule execution statistics** - identify frequently triggered rules
2. **Review false positive rates** - optimize conditions to reduce noise
3. **Update notification recipients** - ensure correct team members receive alerts
4. **Performance optimization** - review and improve slow-running rules
5. **User feedback incorporation** - adjust rules based on team feedback

### Rule Documentation Standards  
- Maintain clear rule descriptions and purposes
- Document all webhook integrations and dependencies
- Keep testing procedures up to date
- Version control rule changes and rollback procedures

This comprehensive automation rule set provides intelligent workflow management for your K8s News Engine DevOps project, ensuring seamless integration between development activities and project tracking in Jira.
