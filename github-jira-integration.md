# GitHub-Jira Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide configures seamless integration between your GitHub repository (`mkolb22/k8s-news-engine`) and your Jira Cloud project (K8SNE) to enable automated issue tracking, status updates, and deployment coordination.

## 1. GitHub Secrets Configuration

### Required Repository Secrets
Navigate to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions:

```bash
# Jira Integration Secrets
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-automation-email@company.com  
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=K8SNE

# Additional Integration Secrets  
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-teams-webhook-url
```

### Jira API Token Creation
1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Label: "K8SNE GitHub Integration"
4. Copy token and store securely in GitHub Secrets as `JIRA_API_TOKEN`

## 2. GitHub Workflow Enhancement

### Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow
Update your `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

```yaml

  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
    tags: ['v*']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

env:
  JIRA_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }}
  JIRA_PROJECT_KEY: ${{ secrets.JIRA_PROJECT_KEY }}

## 3. Branch Naming Conventions

### Standardized Branch Naming
Implement these branch naming conventions to enable automatic Jira linking:

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/K8SNE-3-automated-testing
feature/K8SNE-4-container-security

# Bug fix branches  
bugfix/K8SNE-25-analytics-memory-leak
hotfix/K8SNE-26-critical-api-error

# Release branches
release/v1.2.0-K8SNE-sprint-2

# Examples of commit messages that trigger Jira integration:
git commit -m "K8SNE-3: Add pytest configuration for analytics service"
git commit -m "K8SNE-4: Integrate Trivy security scanning into CI pipeline"
git commit -m "Fix database connection issue - resolves K8SNE-25"
```

## 4. Webhook Configuration

### Jira Webhook Setup

Webhook URL: GitHub webhook URL
Conditions: 
  - Webhook data contains "pull_request"
  - Issue exists in project K8SNE
Actions:
  - Transition issue to "Code Review"
  - Add comment: "Pull request created: {{webhookData.pull_request.html_url}}"
  - Set field "PR Number": {{webhookData.pull_request.number}}
```

### Rule 2: PR Merged Transition  
```yaml
Trigger: Webhook received
Conditions:
  - Webhook data contains "pull_request" 
  - Pull request state is "closed"
  - Pull request merged is true
Actions:
  - Transition issue to "Testing"
  - Add comment: "Pull request merged successfully"
  - Update field "Deployment Environment": "Staging"
```

### Rule 3: Deployment Success Notification
```yaml
Trigger: Webhook received  
Conditions:
  - Webhook data contains "deployment_status"
  - Deployment state is "success"
Actions:
  - Transition issue to "Done" 
  - Add comment: "Deployment successful to {{webhookData.deployment.environment}}"
  - Set Resolution: "Done"
  - Set Environment: {{webhookData.deployment.environment}}
```

### Rule 4: Failed Build Notification
```yaml
Trigger: Webhook received
Conditions:
  - Webhook data contains "workflow_run"
  - Workflow conclusion is "failure"  
Actions:
  - Create linked issue (Bug type)
  - Set summary: "Build failure: {{webhookData.workflow_run.name}}"
  - Assign to: Component lead
  - Set priority: High
  - Add label: "build-failure"
```

## 7. Dashboard Configuration

### GitHub Integration Dashboard
Create a Jira dashboard with these gadgets:

#### Gadget 1: Issues by Status
```jql
project = K8SNE AND "GitHub Repository" is not EMPTY
```

#### Gadget 2: Recent Deployments  
```jql
project = K8SNE AND "Deployment Environment" in (Staging, Production) AND resolved >= -7d
```

#### Gadget 3: Failed Builds
```jql
project = K8SNE AND labels = "build-failure" AND resolution is EMPTY
```

#### Gadget 4: PR Review Backlog
```jql
project = K8SNE AND status = "Code Review" AND "PR Number" is not EMPTY
```

## 8. Slack Integration (Optional)

### Slack Notifications Setup
Add to your GitHub workflow:

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack on Deployment
  if: success() && needs.extract-jira-issues.outputs.issues != ''
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    custom_payload: |
      {
        text: "K8SNE Deployment Complete",
        attachments: [{
          color: '${{ job.status }}' === 'success' ? 'good' : 'danger',
          fields: [{
            title: 'Environment',
            value: '${{ github.ref == "refs/heads/main" && "Staging" || "Production" }}',
            short: true
          }, {
            title: 'Jira Issues',
            value: '${{ needs.extract-jira-issues.outputs.issues }}',
            short: true
          }, {
            title: 'Commit',
            value: '<${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/commit/${{ github.sha }}|${{ github.sha }}>',
            short: true
          }]
        }]
      }
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

## 9. Testing the Integration

### Validation Steps
1. **Create test branch**: `feature/K8SNE-99-integration-test`
2. **Make small change** and commit with: `"K8SNE-99: Test GitHub-Jira integration"`
3. **Create pull request** with title: `"K8SNE-99: Integration test"`
4. **Verify automatic transitions** in Jira issue
5. **Merge PR** and verify final status update
6. **Check Jira comments** for automation updates

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Authentication Issues
- Verify Jira API token is valid and not expired
- Check GitHub repository secrets are correctly configured
- Ensure Jira user has proper permissions for automation

#### Webhook Failures  
- Verify webhook URLs are accessible
- Check webhook payload format matches expected schema
- Review webhook delivery history in both GitHub and Jira

#### Missing Issue Transitions
- Verify workflow transitions are configured correctly
- Check automation rule conditions and actions
- Ensure issue key format matches regex patterns

#### Integration Testing Checklist
- [ ] GitHub Actions can authenticate with Jira
- [ ] Issue keys are extracted from commit messages
- [ ] Issues transition properly through workflow states
- [ ] Comments are added automatically with build/deployment info
- [ ] Failed builds create bug issues automatically  
- [ ] Dashboard shows GitHub integration data correctly
- [ ] Slack notifications work (if configured)

## 10. Maintenance & Monitoring

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

#### Weekly:
- Review webhook delivery logs for failures
- Check for orphaned branches with unlinked issues  
- Validate automation rule execution statistics

#### Monthly:
- Rotate Jira API tokens for security
- Review and optimize automation rule performance
- Update integration documentation with new features

#### Monitoring Metrics:
- Webhook success rate (target: >98%)
- Average issue transition time (target: <4 hours)
- Failed build notification accuracy (target: 100%)
- Developer adoption rate (target: >90% issues linked)

This integration setup provides a robust connection between your GitHub repository and Jira project, enabling automated workflow management and comprehensive DevOps visibility.
